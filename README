- Note 0 (C-2) records audio
- Notes 12-27 (C#-1) start a new voice playing recorded audio back, each from next 16th offset of the buffer
- Note 1 (C#-2) reverses playback

Plugin parameters
- Pass through - disables/enables playing back incoming audio while no buffer playback voices are active
- Fade time - duration of cross-fading between voices or incoming audio
- Speed - playback speed multiplier
