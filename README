This project contains two CLAP/VST3 plugins that can be used to record and play back a buffer.
audio-sampler operates on audio buffers, midi-sampler operates on midi buffers.

*** audio-sampler ***

MIDI bindings
- Note 0 (C-2) records audio while held
- Notes 12-27 (C#-1) start a new voice playing recorded audio back, each from next 16th offset of the buffer
- Note 1 (C#-2) reverses playback
- All other MIDI events are ignored
- No MIDI events are passed through

To get started using the plugin it should be enough to just try it.
However it may not be entirely obvious how some edge cases work, so here's a short description of the plugin's behavior:
- the playback and recording simulates two indepentent cursors moving through the buffer
- initially the buffer has zero length
- when recording starts, recording cursor is reset to beginning
- if recording cursor is at the end of the buffer, buffer gets extended
- once recording stops, buffer is trimmed to the length of the recording.
- playback can be started while recording is still in progress
- initial playback offset is determined by the length of the buffer when playback is started

Plugin parameters
- Pass through - disables/enables playing back incoming audio while no buffer playback voices are active
- Fade time - duration of cross-fading between voices or incoming audio
- Speed - playback speed multiplier

*** midi-sampler ***

This has similar concept as audio-sampler but is not as ready for usage.

MIDI
- Note 0 (C-2) records midi events
- Notes 12-27 (C#-1) start a playing recorded MIDI events back, from 16th offset of the buffer
