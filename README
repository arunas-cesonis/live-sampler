MIDI controlled audio buffer

MIDI
- Note 0 (C-2) records audio
- Notes 12-27 (C#-1) start a new voice playing recorded audio back, each from next 16th offset of the buffer
- While Note 1 (C#-2) is held, playback of any live voice is reversed

Plugin parameters
-  Pass through - disables/enables playing back incoming audio while no buffer playback voices are active
-  Fade time - amount of time in seconds of cross-fading between voices or incoming audio
